### Learning Machine Learning
---

Project goal: 
- Build foundational knowledge on Machine Learning
- I don't have a clear plan yet, but nobody really does at the beginning. This project will evolve overtime. 

---

Current State: 
- Exploring Linear Regression:
  1. Created a neural network of one neuron and fit some data into it, resulting in the linear Formula: y = mx + b. 
  2. Creating a linear regression model based on a mocked real-world example
- Random Forest Classifier:
  1. Created a random forest model by following kaggle's titanic survival prediction walkthroughs.
 
What could be better:
- Sure, I'm learning important concepts, but still feel like I'm not truly writing machine learning code.
- This is because Mathematical theory still lacks, therefore I'll shift more towards Linear Algebra in the context of ML.
